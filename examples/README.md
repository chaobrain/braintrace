# Examples of ``braintrace``

We provide the following kinds of examples to demonstrate the use of the ``braintrace`` package.

- The application fo the ``braintrace`` package to spiking neural networks, with filenames starting with ``0xx_``.
- The application of the ``braintrace`` package to rate-based recurrent neural networks, with filenames starting with ``1xx_``.

All the python files can be directly run in the terminal. For example, to run the file ``001-gif-snn-for-dms.py``, you can use the following command:

```bash

python 001-gif-snn-for-dms.py

```

The examples require the following packages:


- numpy
- matplotlib
