As demonstrated in [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.24.614728), the learning of temporal dependencies in `braintrace` is achieved through the dynamical updates of these element-wise operational state variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of how to implement online learning for RNNs using the `braintrace` framework. Notably, `braintrace` is particularly well-suited for complex RNN models with gating mechanisms, such as LSTM and GRU. In contrast, for RNN models like Vanilla RNNs, which rely solely on weight interactions to induce recurrence, the `braintrace` online learning system struggles to support accurate gradient computation.\n",

    "We hope this tutorial will assist researchers and engineers in effectively utilizing the `braintrace` online learning system to address challenges encountered in the practical training of RNNs."
